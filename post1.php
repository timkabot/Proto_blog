       	<p class="text-left bg-info" style="padding: 5px;">
        Last month, as part of my “go offline” February, I went to Patagonia with Intrepid Travel and hiked the famous W Trek in Torres Del Paine (and the Perito Moreno Glacier in El Calafate). I’ve never done a multi-day trek before and, by the end, my legs were incredibly sore (and so were my eyes because I stopped blinking for four days. Torres was AMAZING!). But the trip was one of the best things I’ve done and made me realize I need to get out into nature more.

While I’ll be writing about the trip in detail in the next two weeks, today I wanted to share some of my photos from the trip. I don’t often post photo posts but since Patagonia was one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever seen, I feel compelled. Everything is huge there  — the mountains, glaciers, waterfalls, and lakes  — and you just feel so small. You really get a sense of just how tiny we are compared to nature!

I’ll share my experience and some tips in the next post but for now, let’s end this week with some pretty photos:
        <img src="img/post1/1.jpg" class=" image-rounded " style="width: 100%;margin: 15px;" align="left">
        The famous Torres Towers, that have a 22km hike and 900 meter steep ascent. Seeing them on such a beautiful day was the highlight of the trip for me. I spent close to two hours here just enjoying the moment.
        <img src="img/post1/2.jpg" class=" image-rounded " style="width: 100%;margin: 15px;" align="left">Glacier Grey.
        <img src="img/post1/3.jpg" class=" image-rounded " style="width: 100%;margin: 15px;" align="left">On the way to Glacier Grey.
        <img src="img/post1/4.jpg" class=" image-rounded " style="width: 100%;margin: 15px;" align="left">On the way to Glacier Grey there’s a beautiful lake with icebergs! The water is gray because of the dirt and silt that melts with the glacier.
